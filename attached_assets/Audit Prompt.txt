Please perform a comprehensive security and vulnerability audit of my bot’s codebase, with a focus on protecting user wallets and preventing malicious exploits. My bot uses WalletConnect for signing and interacting with user wallets. Evaluate the system against the following threat categories:

1. Wallet & Signing Security

Is there any possibility of a malicious or unintended transaction being triggered by the bot on behalf of the user?

Are all signed transactions initiated only by explicit user actions, not automatic or timed logic?

Are WalletConnect sessions securely managed, expired correctly, and never reused across users?

Are transaction payloads clean, verified, and not vulnerable to injection or manipulation?




> 2. API & Endpoint Security

Could an attacker spoof API requests (e.g., APR or pool data) to trick the bot into recommending or executing harmful actions?

Are the Express endpoints and Telegram bot inputs protected against command injection, parameter tampering, or rate abuse?

Are any sensitive operations (like investment decisions or withdrawals) locked behind user validation and signature, not just API calls?




> 3. Session, User & Message Safety

Is there any risk that users can interfere with other users’ sessions, wallets, or data?

Are session identifiers and user contexts stored and scoped strictly per Telegram user ID or wallet address?

Are system commands sanitized and validated to prevent spoofed input from malicious messages or forwarded commands?




> 4. Data Handling & Key Security

Are any private keys, seed phrases, or API keys stored or exposed anywhere in the backend, logs, or responses?

Are WalletConnect connection URIs protected from being hijacked or logged in plaintext?




> 5. Smart Contract & On-Chain Interaction Risks

Does the bot validate the pool addresses, token pairs, and contract interactions before suggesting or executing trades?

Could an attacker substitute a malicious liquidity pool to phish user funds?

Is any pool recommendation logic vulnerable to data source manipulation or front-running?
