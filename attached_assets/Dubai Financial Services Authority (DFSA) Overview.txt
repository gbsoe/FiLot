Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) Overview

The DFSA is the independent regulator of all financial services conducted in or from the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), a purpose-built financial free zone established under UAE federal law in 2004. It operates under its own legislative framework, distinct from the broader UAE securities and commodities regulator, to uphold international standards of integrity, transparency, and market confidence within the DIFC .
