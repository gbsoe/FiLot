      # --- Additional Fundamental Market Concepts ---
      "what is liquidity pool": (
          "A *liquidity pool* is a smart contract that holds fundsâ€”often in paired cryptocurrenciesâ€”to facilitate trading on decentralized exchanges.\n\n"
          "Key aspects include:\n"
          "â€¢ *Decentralized Trading:* Traders swap tokens directly against the pool instead of using a central order book.\n"
          "â€¢ *Earning Fees:* Liquidity providers earn a share of the trading fees proportional to their contribution.\n"
          "â€¢ *Risk Consideration:* Although liquidity pools can yield high returns, they also carry risks such as impermanent loss.\n\n"
          "By providing liquidity through FiLot, users can potentially earn far more than with traditional savings accounts."
      ),

      "impermanent loss": (
          "*Impermanent loss* (IL) occurs when the value of your deposited tokens changes relative to each other, "
          "resulting in a temporary loss compared to simply holding the tokens.\n\n"
          "Key points:\n"
          "â€¢ *Price Divergence:* IL happens when the relative prices of tokens in a pool diverge.\n"
          "â€¢ *Temporary Impact:* The loss is 'impermanent' because if prices return to their original levels, the loss is reversed.\n"
          "â€¢ *Mitigation Strategies:* FiLotâ€™s AI selects stable, high-liquidity pools to help minimize the risk of IL."
      ),

      # --- Basic and Mainstream Market Q&A ---

      ),

      "what is defi": (
          "*DeFi* stands for Decentralized Finance. It is a suite of financial services built on blockchain technology that operates without centralized intermediaries like banks.\n\n"
          "Through smart contracts, DeFi platforms allow users to lend, borrow, trade, and earn interestâ€”often achieving returns significantly higher than those offered by traditional finance."
      ),

      "what is crypto": (
          "*Crypto* is short for cryptocurrencyâ€”a type of digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security.\n\n"
          "Cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks like blockchains, ensuring secure, transparent, and efficient transactions without the need for central authorities."
      ),

      "what is blockchain": (
          "*Blockchain* is a distributed ledger technology that records transactions across multiple computers in a secure, transparent, and immutable manner.\n\n"
          "It underpins cryptocurrencies and enables decentralized applications by ensuring that once data is recorded, it cannot be altered retroactively without consensus."
      ),

      "what are tokens": (
          "*Tokens* are digital assets created on a blockchain. They can represent various values or utilitiesâ€”ranging from serving as a currency to granting access rights, rewards, or governance roles within a decentralized ecosystem."
      ),

      "what is ai": (
          "*AI*, or Artificial Intelligence, is a branch of computer science focused on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human-like intelligence, such as decision-making, pattern recognition, and natural language processing."
      ),

      "how do i start investing": (
          "To start investing in crypto, begin by educating yourself on blockchain technology and market trends. With FiLot, type /start for an introduction, check current opportunities with /info, and simulate potential returns with /simulate. Always invest only what you can afford to lose and conduct thorough research before making any decisions."
      ),

      "how to read crypto charts": (
          "Crypto charts display key metrics such as price movements, trading volume, and market trends. Learning basic technical analysis can help you interpret these charts.\n\n"
          "FiLot simplifies this process by providing clear, real-time insights and analytics, making it easier for beginners to understand the market."
      ),

      "what is trading": (
          "*Trading* involves buying and selling assets with the goal of making a profit from price fluctuations.\n\n"
          "In the volatile crypto market, trading can be risky, but platforms like FiLot help by identifying high-yield liquidity pools and optimizing your investment strategy."
      ),

      "what is apr": (
          "*APR* (Annual Percentage Rate) represents the yearly rate of return on an investment without accounting for compounding.\n\n"
          "Traditional banks typically offer around 0.5% to 2% APR, whereas liquidity pools on FiLot can offer APRs ranging from 10% up to 200% or more.\n\n"
          "For example, a $1,000 investment at a 50% APR might yield approximately $500 in one year (before compounding), which is significantly higher than what a conventional bank deposit would earn."
      ),

      "what is apy": (
          "*APY* (Annual Percentage Yield) takes into account the effects of compounding, providing a more comprehensive view of potential earnings over a year.\n\n"
          "While traditional savings accounts might yield an APY of around 1% to 2%, liquidity pools on FiLot can have APYs ranging from 10% to well over 200%, depending on market conditions and the compounding frequency."
      ),

      "compare bank interest": (
          "Traditional bank interest rates typically range from *0.5%* to *2%* per year. In contrast, crypto liquidity poolsâ€”especially those identified by FiLotâ€”can offer APRs between *10%* and *200%+*.\n\n"
          "For example, a *$1,000* deposit at a *1%* bank interest rate would earn about *$10* to *$20* in a year, whereas the same *$1,000* investment in a high-yield liquidity pool on FiLot could yield between *$100* and *$500* or more annually. This stark contrast illustrates the potential for significantly higher returns."
      ),

      "what can i ask": (
          "You can ask a wide range of questions about FiLot and the crypto market. For example, you can inquire about:\n\n"
