Here’s an updated, more detailed overview with the latest Raydium metrics and security information  please update you pool page using this new information.

Summary

Raydium remains Solana’s leading AMM and liquidity provider, recently hitting an all-time high TVL of $2.589 billion and processing over $1.2 billion in 24 h DEX volume. In Q1 2025 its average daily trading volume reached $3.6 billion, a 12.7% MoM increase, underscoring its dominance in Solana’s DeFi landscape. Built in 2021, Raydium combines a “constant-product” AMM with on-chain limit-order functionality via OpenBook, offering fast trades, deep liquidity, and yield farming. Security is backed by multiple audits (Kudelski, Neodyme, Quantstamp, OtterSec, Halborn) and a bug-bounty program; even after a $4.4 million pool-key hack in Nov 2022, the protocol has strengthened its defenses and continues to innovate.

What Are Liquidity Pools?

Liquidity pools are on-chain smart contracts that hold paired token reserves, letting traders swap directly against the pool rather than a counterparty . By depositing tokens, liquidity providers earn a proportional share of each swap’s fees, converting idle tokens into a yield-generating asset.

Core AMM & Hybrid Model

Raydium’s on-chain AMM uses the “constant-product” formula (x·y = k) for swaps, while sharing liquidity with OpenBook’s limit-order book via Fibonacci-sequenced orders—combining AMM depth with order-book precision . Since launching in February 2021, it has enabled permissionless pool creation, yield farming, and its AcceleRaytor launchpad for new-token distributions .
