## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing handlers for these 1000 button-driven scenarios, consider the following:

1. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent UI patterns across all three main flows
2. **Fault Tolerance**: Handle unexpected user inputs gracefully
3. **Context Awareness**: Remember user's position in conversation flow
4. **Navigation Clarity**: Always provide clear path back to main menu
5. **Error Recovery**: Make it easy to recover from errors or confusion
6. **Progressive Disclosure**: Present information in manageable chunks
7. **User Memory**: Don't require users to remember information across steps
8. **Response Speed**: Optimize for quick responses to maintain engagement
9. **State Management**: Track user state accurately across interaction paths
10. **Conversation Flow**: Maintain natural conversation despite button-driven structure
