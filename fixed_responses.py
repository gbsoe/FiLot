        "what is liquidity pool": (
            "A *liquidity pool* is a smart contract that holds funds—often in paired cryptocurrencies—to facilitate trading on decentralized exchanges.\n\n"
            "Key aspects include:\n"
            "• *Decentralized Trading:* Traders swap tokens directly against the pool instead of using a central order book.\n"
            "• *Earning Fees:* Liquidity providers earn a share of the trading fees proportional to their contribution.\n"
            "• *Risk Consideration:* Although liquidity pools can yield high returns, they also carry risks such as impermanent loss.\n\n"
            "By providing liquidity through FiLot, users can potentially earn far more than with traditional savings accounts."

        "what is apr": (
            "*APR* (Annual Percentage Rate) represents the yearly interest generated by an investment, not accounting "
            "for compounding. In DeFi, APR typically comes from trading fees and token rewards. For example, a 100% APR "
            "means your investment would theoretically double in a year if rates remained stable. However, DeFi APRs "
            "fluctuate based on trading volume, token prices, and market conditions."
        ),

        "impermanent loss": (
            "*Impermanent loss* occurs when the price ratio of tokens in a liquidity pool changes compared to when you "
            "deposited them. If you had simply held the tokens instead of providing liquidity, you might have more value. "
            "The loss is 'impermanent' because it can decrease or disappear if token prices return to the original ratio. "
            "Higher volatility between token pairs leads to greater impermanent loss risk."
        ),

        "risk assessment": (
            "FiLot assesses investment risk through multiple factors:\n"
            "• Volatility: How much token prices fluctuate\n"
            "• Liquidity: Pool size and trading volume\n"
            "• Protocol security: Smart contract audits and history\n"
            "• Token fundamentals: Project backing and use cases\n"
            "• Market correlation: How tokens move in relation to broader markets\n"

            "needing to connect your actual wallet. This is read-only and doesn't require permissions.\n\n"
            "2. *WalletConnect integration* (/walletconnect command): Use the WalletConnect protocol for a secure, "
            "encrypted connection between FiLot and your wallet. This allows more detailed portfolio analysis but "
