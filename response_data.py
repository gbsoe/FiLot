            "A *liquidity pool* is a collection of cryptocurrency tokens locked in a smart contract that facilitates "
            "trading, lending, and other DeFi activities. Liquidity providers (LPs) deposit equal values of two tokens "
            "to create trading pairs (like SOL/USDC). In return, LPs earn fees from trades executed against that pool "
            "and often additional rewards in the form of APR/APY."

        "what is apr": (
            "*APR* (Annual Percentage Rate) represents the yearly interest generated by an investment, not accounting "
            "for compounding. In DeFi, APR typically comes from trading fees and token rewards. For example, a 100% APR "
            "means your investment would theoretically double in a year if rates remained stable. However, DeFi APRs "
            "fluctuate based on trading volume, token prices, and market conditions."
        ),

        "impermanent loss": (
            "*Impermanent loss* occurs when the price ratio of tokens in a liquidity pool changes compared to when you "
            "deposited them. If you had simply held the tokens instead of providing liquidity, you might have more value. "
            "The loss is 'impermanent' because it can decrease or disappear if token prices return to the original ratio. "
            "Higher volatility between token pairs leads to greater impermanent loss risk."
        ),

        "risk assessment": (
            "FiLot assesses investment risk through multiple factors:\n"
            "• Volatility: How much token prices fluctuate\n"
            "• Pool TVL: Higher liquidity generally means lower risk\n"
            "• Smart contract security: Based on audit status and history\n"
            "• Impermanent loss potential: Higher in volatile token pairs\n"
            "• Protocol reputation: Established protocols typically present lower risk\n"
