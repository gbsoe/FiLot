- `coingecko_utils.py`: Token price retrieval from CoinGecko

### Existing Commands
- `/start`, `/help`: Basic bot information
- `/info`: Display current pool information
- `/simulate`: Calculate potential returns
- `/wallet`, `/walletconnect`: Connect user wallets
- `/profile`: Set user investment preferences
- `/subscribe`, `/unsubscribe`: Manage update notifications
