# FiLot Button-Based UI Implementation Report

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of a button-driven user interface for the FiLot Telegram bot, replacing the previous command-driven approach with a more accessible and user-friendly interaction model.

## Design Philosophy
The button-based UI aims to:
1. **Reduce Friction** - Eliminate the need for users to type commands
2. **Improve Accessibility** - Make all features discoverable without memorizing commands
3. **Support Repeated Actions** - Allow buttons to work correctly even when pressed multiple times
4. **Create Consistent Navigation** - Provide a cohesive experience across all bot sections

## Implementation Details

### 2. Account Section Buttons

### 3. Invest Section Improvements
- **Amount Selection**: Implemented specialized handlers for fixed amounts (100, 500, 1000, 5000)
- **Custom Amount**: Added support for entering custom investment amounts

4. **Notification Buttons**: Add customizable alert settings with inline toggles
