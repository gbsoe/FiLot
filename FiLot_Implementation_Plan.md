## Priorities for Immediate Implementation

### 1. Transaction Execution System
The most critical component is the ability to execute transactions safely and reliably, which requires:
- Complete WalletConnect integration
- Transaction creation and signing workflow
- On-chain verification of transaction status
- Comprehensive error handling

### 2. Portfolio Tracking
To provide value to users immediately, we need:
- Accurate tracking of user investments
- Real-time performance monitoring
- Fee and reward calculations
- Historical performance visualization

### 3. Basic Automation Rules
Start with simple but powerful automation:
- Periodic investment rules (e.g., weekly investing)
- Threshold-based actions (e.g., invest when APR exceeds X%)
- Profit-taking rules (e.g., withdraw when returns exceed Y%)

## Technical Dependencies

### External Services
- **Raydium API**: For real-time pool data (existing)
- **Solana RPC**: For blockchain interactions
- **WalletConnect**: For wallet connection and transaction signing
- **CoinGecko API**: For token price data (existing)

### Development Resources
- **Database Migration Tools**: For safe schema updates
- **Blockchain Development Tools**: For transaction building and verification
- **Testing Wallets**: For transaction testing without real funds
- **Security Auditing Tools**: For code and transaction safety verification

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **Blockchain Network Issues**: Implement fallback RPC providers and retry logic
- **Transaction Failures**: Build robust verification and rollback mechanisms
- **Data Availability**: Create caching and fallback data sources

### User Risks
- **Financial Loss**: Implement strict transaction limits and confirmation flows
- **Security Breaches**: Use multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations
- **Misunderstanding**: Provide clear explanations of all investment recommendations

## Success Metrics

### User Adoption
- Number of users connecting wallets
- Percentage of users executing transactions
- Number of automation rules created

### Performance
- Portfolio returns compared to market benchmarks
- Recommendation accuracy and confidence scores
- System uptime and response times

### User Satisfaction
- Feedback ratings on recommendations
- Time spent using portfolio features
- Number of referrals from existing users

## Conclusion
This implementation plan provides a structured approach to building FiLot's agentic investment capabilities. By focusing on secure transaction execution, intelligent decision-making, and user-controlled automation, we will transform FiLot into a powerful tool for optimizing cryptocurrency investments while maintaining appropriate safeguards and user control.

The phased approach allows for incremental delivery of value to users while managing complexity and ensuring robust testing at each stage.
