# Message Looping Bug Fix

## Problem Description

The FiLot Telegram Bot was experiencing severe message looping issues:
- Multiple identical responses to the same user message
- Duplicate callback query handling
- Competing server processes causing message loops
- Poor user experience due to chat flooding

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Competing Processes**: Both wsgi.py and main.py were running separate instances of the bot, each polling the Telegram API independently.

2. **Duplicate Message Tracking**: The previous message tracking mechanisms were insufficient and didn't prevent all edge cases.

3. **Callback Query Handling**: Multiple handlers in both bot.py and main.py were processing the same callback queries.

4. **No Process Locking**: There was no locking mechanism to ensure only one bot instance was running at a time.

## Solution Implemented

The solution employs a multi-layered approach:

### 1. Process-Level Protection

- Created a file-based locking system that ensures only one bot instance can run
- Added ability to detect and terminate competing bot processes
- Implemented instance ID tracking to identify which process is handling messages

### 2. Database-Backed Message Tracking

- Added SQLite database tracking for all messages and callbacks
- Used hash-based message fingerprinting to detect similar messages
- Implemented time-based expiration of message tracking

### 3. Bot Framework Patching

- Added function decorators that patch key message handling functions in bot.py
- Implemented monkey-patching for better compatibility

### 4. Callback Centralization

- Created a centralized callback registry and router in callback_handler.py
- Ensured all callback queries go through a single path regardless of source

## Files Changed

1. **anti_loop.py** - Core protection system with monkey patching capabilities
2. **debug_message_tracking.py** - SQLite-backed message tracking with process locking
3. **callback_handler.py** - Centralized callback handling registry
4. **main.py** - Added instance locking and anti-loop protection
5. **wsgi.py** - Added instance locking and competing process detection
6. **bot.py** - Enhanced callback handling with anti-loop protection

## Testing

This solution has been tested under high load conditions with:
- Multiple simultaneous users
- Rapid button clicking
- Multiple processes trying to run concurrently

## Usage Notes

- The `.bot_instance.lock` file indicates an active bot instance
- If the bot fails to start due to a lock, but no bot is running, delete this file
- The `bot_status.db` file contains message tracking data
- If needed, the tracking can be reset by deleting `bot_status.db` and restarting

## Future Improvements

1. Add a centralized message queue for more robust message handling
2. Implement Redis-based tracking for distributed deployments
3. Add webhook support as an alternative to polling
